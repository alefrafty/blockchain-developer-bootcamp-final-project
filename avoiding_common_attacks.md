The Masterblock contract protects against the following attack vectors:

SWC-131 - Presence of unused variables
All variables defined have been defined and initialized. All unused variables have been removed

SWC-123 - Requirement violations
When the game configuration is setup since the random entries will come from the front end, the inputs 
are sanitized using 'require' statements to guarantee the game will operate as designed and the user
will be able to find a feasibleaaaa solution.
